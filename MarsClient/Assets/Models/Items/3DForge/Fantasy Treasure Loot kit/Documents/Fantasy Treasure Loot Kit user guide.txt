Thanks for purchasing this pakage.

Animated items:
Stone Chests, Large Wooden Chests, Small Wooden Chests as well as the Jewelry Boxes is animation ready.
Ckicking on the Items under /Meshes/Containers/... you can preview the individual open and close animations
1 - 4   Idle
4 - 41  Open
41 - 77 Close

Breakable items:
Crates, Barrels & Urns each have a Fixed State and a broken state models included for each of the textures sets
They would be used where the developer would swop the fixed model with the broken version and hide the swop
with a particle effect, be it a dust burst, a flame, a flash or what ever they desire.

Textures:
All textures are 512 x 512
I have tested scaling down to 256 x 256 and even 128 x 128 still givs god results.

Send some screenshots to info@3dforge.co.za of your work and I will showcase them on the website

Enjoy
